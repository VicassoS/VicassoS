### Projects

Here are some projects that I've worked on:

1. [Fault with Curiosity](https://github.com/CodenameAlphamale/FaultWithCuriosity): A 3D horror puzzle game created in Unity, with code written in C# and maps designed in Blender. Developed as a collaborative project for the II1305 course, Project in Information and Communication Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Key features include LAN multiplayer, an inventory system, flashlight and camera mechanics, a 3D environment, Character Controller, and individual enemy AI. 
2. [Snake](https://github.com/VicassoS/IS1200-Datorteknik/tree/main/miniprojekt): A classic game of Snake implemented for the UNO32 ChipKIT Microcontroller using C and Assembly. Developed as a two-person project for the IS1200 course, Computer Hardware Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Key features include a 1v1 mode, single-player mode, menu system, high-score tracking, and external mechanical key inputs. 
3. [HTTP Handlers](https://github.com/VicassoS/IK1203-Natverk-och-kommunikation): HTTP Request Handlers written in Java, designed to process HTTP GET requests for sending and receiving data from other websites. Developed as part of the IK1203 course, Networks and Communications at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, focusing on concurrency and HTTP error handling.
